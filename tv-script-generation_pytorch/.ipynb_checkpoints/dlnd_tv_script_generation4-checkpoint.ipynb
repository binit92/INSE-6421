I chose my embedding_dim to be 200, because the data set used is small. I wanted my hidden_dim to be greater than my embeddings so I decided to pick 256. Furthermore, I chose a relativly large batch size to help speed up converging, and decided on an n_layer of 2 as anything above 3 had been shown  to demonstrate little improvement. "
